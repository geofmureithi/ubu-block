# ubu-block

Uchaguzi bila Ubaguzi Blockchain

## Features

1. Immutable: You can't make changes only append so no `fungua server` and other shenanigans.
2. Distributed: No single point of data storage.
3. Accessible: Runs on sqlite which is well supported in most platforms.
4. Community driven: Dynamic number of signatories

## Getting Started

```
git clone <repo> ubu-block
cd ubu-block
```

If you want to run binaries without installing rust:

1. Get the latest binary from the releases page.
2. Replace `cargo run` with `ubu-block`
3. Download the relevant files see `Setup initial files`

### Setup initial files

```
mkdir data

# Create the db files
cp src/sql/empty.db data/blockchain.db
cp src/sql/empty.db data/private.db

```

### Initialize a Blockchain

```
cargo run init --creator "Njuguna Mureithi"
```

You should get:

```
INFO  ubu_block] Blockchain was successfully initialized!
```

### Add some blocks

Currently `ubu-block` has very limited dummy data, but this should change as soon as IEBC publishes the voter register

For testing purposes, I used limited data from previous by elections. See `src/sql/main_db.sql`

```
cargo run insert --station 022113056303301 --candidate 1 --votes 66
cargo run insert --station 022113056303301 --candidate 2 --votes 21
```

You should get:

```
INFO ubu_block] Block was added successfully!
```

### Validate our blockchain

```
cargo run validate
```

You should get:

```
INFO ubu_block] Blockchain is valid!
```

### Querying

```
cargo run query -q "Select
  c.name as candidate,
   SUM(votes) as votes,
  ward_name as ward,
  constituency_name as constituency,
  county_name as county,
  parties.title as party
from
  results
  INNER JOIN stations ON stations.id = results.station_id
  INNER JOIN candidates c ON c.id = results.candidate_id
  INNER JOIN wards on stations.ward_code = wards.ward_code
  INNER JOIN parties ON parties.id = c.party_id
  INNER JOIN constituencies ON wards.constituency_code = constituencies.constituency_code
  INNER JOIN counties ON constituencies.county_code = counties.county_code
WHERE
  position_type = 'Mp'  and constituency = 'Juja' GROUP BY candidate ;"
```

**_NOTE:_** Currently each query has to return the following columns to work: candidate, votes, ward, constituency, county, party. This is just a temporary issue and should fixed in the next release

You should get:

```
+--------+--------------+----------+-----------+-------+-------+
| county | constituency |   ward   | candidate | party | votes |
+--------+--------------+----------+-----------+-------+-------+
| Kiambu |     Juja     | Kalimoni |   Omosh   |  ODM  |  21   |
+--------+--------------+----------+-----------+-------+-------+
| Kiambu |     Juja     | Kalimoni |   Mwas    |  PNU  |  66   |
+--------+--------------+----------+-----------+-------+-------+
```

### Trying to steal the election for Omosh

Since immutability is one of our main goal, lets try to edit votes for `Omosh` and see if we can get away with it

Open `blockchain.db` with your favourite sqlite editor and run a query that updates the results:

```sql
UPDATE "results" SET "votes"= 71 WHERE _rowid_ =1
```

Running `query` again we get:

```
+--------+--------------+----------+-----------+-------+-------+
| county | constituency |   ward   | candidate | party | votes |
+--------+--------------+----------+-----------+-------+-------+
| Kiambu |     Juja     | Kalimoni |   Omosh   |  ODM  |  71   |
+--------+--------------+----------+-----------+-------+-------+
| Kiambu |     Juja     | Kalimoni |   Mwas    |  PNU  |  66   |
+--------+--------------+----------+-----------+-------+-------+
```

Wow congrats to Omosh!

There is a petition, lets try validating our blockchain

```
cargo run validate

thread 'main' panicked at 'Could not verify block, found 0e70cebe0ab3bd8c3606a08d26483d092534eea4ccdb7816fc2692aee5ed3109, block: Block {... CandidateResult { station_id: 22113056303301, candidate_id: 1, votes: 71 }]......', src/db.rs:189:17

```

How about that? No `fungua servers` and everything is public and sql friendly

## Free Public Servers

Below are the servers you are using for free, it may change along the time. If you are not close to one of these, your network may be slow.
| Location | Vendor | Specification |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| France | Vultr | 1 VCPU / 1GB RAM |

**_NOTE:_** This will be accessible when `p2p` is ready (hopefully in the next release).

## Roadmap

v 0.3

- [ ] Http API
- [ ] Mobile and Web apps

v 0.2

- [ ] P2p - ability to add nodes
- [ ] Fill regional data
- [ ] Views to simplify quering
